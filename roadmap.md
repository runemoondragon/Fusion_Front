 Roadmap to Sub-Model Integration (e.g., GPT-4.5 Routing)
✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Provider-Level Stability)
 Implement context_sanitizer.py and confirm it’s applied before .chat() in all providers

 Remove legacy patches from individual providers (e.g., tool_name hacks)

 Ensure full history continuity across provider switches

 All providers can handle tools and tool_result cycles without breaking

 Document supported capabilities per provider (image gen, function calls, etc.)

✅ Phase 2: Manual Provider Control
 User can manually select OpenAI, Claude, Gemini

 NeuroSwitch routing logic respects user override

 Provider buttons (e.g., “Deep Research”) are functional and scoped to manual mode

✅ Phase 3: Sub-Model Selection System
 Add model-level config in config.py per provider:

python
Copy
Edit
OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o"
GEMINI_MODEL = "gemini-1.5-pro-latest"
CLAUDE_MODEL = "claude-3-sonnet-20240229"
 Refactor .chat() methods to read from dynamic model string (not hardcoded)

 Optional: Allow model override via metadata or prompt tag (e.g., “@model:4.5”)

✅ Phase 4: Sub-Model Routing Logic
 Add a light scoring system (performance vs cost vs tool use)

 Implement a model_selector.py module

 Add fallback rules: if GPT-4o fails → retry GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.5

✅ Phase 5: UI/UX for Model-Level Control
 Dropdown selector or command tag system (@model:gpt-4.5)

 Optional: Show estimated token cost or latency per model in tooltip

✅ Optional Enhancements
 Add usage stats per model to dashboard

 Add user preferences to remember last selected model per provider

 Enable “automatic fallback” with logs explaining reroutes

What You've Done (So Far)
🔧 Infrastructure & Backend:
Deployed Fusion AI backend with Flask for orchestration.

Implemented local zero-shot classification via facebook/bart-large-mnli using Hugging Face Transformers.

Removed dependency on external HF API → improved latency + privacy.

Set up NeuroSwitch classifier for AI provider routing.

Built robust logging/debug system during zero-shot inference and request routing.

Added provider fallback logic (default = Claude).

🧠 AI Providers:
Integrated OpenAI, Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini with individual provider files.

Handled partial context compatibility between Claude ↔ OpenAI ↔ Gemini.

Began planning context sanitization (to fix Gemini throwing tantrums).

Set up provider switching based on labels (LABEL_PROVIDER_MAP).

Implemented conversational continuity across AI models using shared conversation_history.

🧪 Testing & Tools:
Ran live continuity tests between models (e.g., blog post from Gemini ideas → OpenAI writeup).

Integrated file editing tools (diffeditortool, fileedittool).

Conducted real-world context conflict tests.

Used Claude and OpenAI to collaboratively write and edit the same HTML file (yes, that worked).

🧱 Frontend & Auth:
Created marketing-ready landing page (Fusion AI branding, logos, sections).

Login system with email + social auth (Google, Apple, etc.).

Post-login dashboard routing to chat interface.

Chat UI wired to NeuroSwitch for smart routing.

📌 What You’re Working On Now
☑️ Build context_sanitizer.py for model-specific history preprocessing.

⬜️ Add real-time dynamic model scoring using llm-stats.com or equivalent.

⬜️ Add price-based routing weight into task assignment logic.

⬜️ Add slider UI: user-defined priority (cost ↔ accuracy).

⬜️ Deploy backend API endpoint (/neuroswitch/api) for external access.

⬜️ Protect backend using Cloudflare Tunnel + domain + login.

⬜️ Add “Coming Soon” roadmap section to frontend.

⬜️ Add roadmap to database or markdown + display to user (optional).

🧭 Roadmap (Next)
🧪 Short-Term Goals (v1.5-v2):
Auto-correct classification misfires with user feedback (supervised training).

Let user pick between top-2 model answers.

Track per-query cost and score → adaptive routing weight.

🚀 Mid-Term Goals (v2-v3):
Add fine-tuning pipeline for the local classifier (with labeled data).

Track user performance → score models for personalization.

Add more model providers: Meta, Mistral, xAI, Qwen, DeepSeek.

🔐 Deployment Plan:
Host frontend publicly.

Expose backend securely via domain tunnel.

Use Flask rate-limiting + domain header check for security.
